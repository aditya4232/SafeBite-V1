# Guest User Experience Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Guest Name Prompt**
   - Modified the GuestNamePrompt component to prevent closing without entering a name
   - Added prevention for Escape key and clicking outside to dismiss the dialog
   - Improved the user experience by requiring a name to continue

2. **Guest Login Flow**
   - Updated guestAuthService to clear any existing guest name when logging in as a guest
   - This ensures the name prompt appears for each new guest session
   - Prevents old guest names from persisting across sessions

3. **Welcome Message**
   - Enhanced the welcome toast notification to handle both cases:
     - When a guest name is available, show a personalized welcome
     - When no guest name is available, show a generic welcome
   - Ensures consistent user experience regardless of state

4. **Dashboard Display**
   - Fixed the welcome message in the GuestDashboard to properly show the guest's name
   - Removed hardcoded "Aditya Shenvi" from the footer
   - Simplified the footer to show only the version number

5. **Sidebar Display**
   - Updated the DashboardSidebar component to show the guest's name instead of "Guest User"
   - Ensures consistent display of the guest name throughout the application

## Technical Improvements

1. **State Management**
   - Improved state handling for guest name in localStorage
   - Added proper conditional rendering based on guest name availability

2. **User Experience**
   - Made the name prompt modal persistent until a name is entered
   - Added validation to ensure a non-empty name is provided
   - Improved toast notifications with personalized messages

3. **Code Organization**
   - Ensured consistent handling of guest mode across components
   - Improved error handling and edge cases

## Next Steps

1. **Guest Data Persistence**
   - Consider adding more guest preferences to localStorage for a more personalized experience
   - Implement a way to convert guest data to user data when signing up

2. **Enhanced Guest Features**
   - Add more features that work well in guest mode
   - Improve the indication of which features require a full account
