# Changes Made to SafeBite Application

## 1. Fixed Food Search Functionality

The food search functionality has been enhanced and simplified:

- Now uses a single API (CalorieNinjas) for more reliable and consistent results
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Added input validation to prevent empty searches
- Enhanced nutrition score calculation based on nutrient values
- Properly tracks user interactions for future ML insights
- Provides clear feedback when no results are found

## 2. Fixed Guest Dashboard

The guest dashboard has been fixed to:

- Properly include the sidebar when in guest mode
- Show "Welcome, Guest" instead of "Welcome Aditya"
- Maintain consistent layout with the regular dashboard

## 3. Fixed HealthBox Component

The HealthBox component has been fixed by:

- Adding missing state variables (`saveModalOpen` and `currentToolData`)
- Implementing the missing `handleSaveResults` function
- Adding proper guest mode detection to prevent saving results when in guest mode
- Tracking user interactions with health tools

## 4. Added Missing Functions

Added the missing `trackUserInteraction` function to the foodApiService to track user interactions with food items.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the food search functionality with various food items to ensure it works correctly.
2. **User Experience**: Consider adding more visual feedback during searches, such as loading indicators or animations.
3. **Error Handling**: Continue to improve error handling for edge cases, such as network issues or API rate limiting.
4. **Performance**: Monitor the performance of the food search functionality and optimize if necessary.
5. **Data Persistence**: Ensure that user preferences and search history are properly saved and retrieved.
